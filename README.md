# What-The-Kale
This is a website creation for a Juicery opening up in June.
The location of the Juicery is 1120 Royvonne Avenue Southeast, Salem, OR.
All of the work is mine. While I did use some others code (for example getting code from stack overflow), the design and everything is mine.
I did use a theme from the internet but that was for a foundation. I changed everything. It was to speed up development
